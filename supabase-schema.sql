-- GOLSZ — Supabase schema reference (current live state)
--
-- This file documents what is ACTUALLY deployed against the live GOLSZ
-- Supabase project (ref: wachjqfhlbchcuovyewg), confirmed via direct
-- information_schema / pg_proc / pg_policies introspection, plus every
-- migration applied since (002, 004, 005 — concatenated below in order).
--
-- ⚠️ THIS IS NOT A FROM-SCRATCH BOOTSTRAP SCRIPT. It assumes the base
-- tables already exist: profiles, athletes, coaches, agents, clubs,
-- parent_links, scout_history. Those predate this migration history and
-- were never fully re-documented here.
--
-- profiles.plan is a Postgres enum (plan_tier) confirmed LIVE via direct
-- write attempts (2026-07-15): valid values are 'starter' | 'pro' |
-- 'elite' — there is NO 'free' value. Every check in this codebase now
-- uses 'starter' for the free tier (fixed in migration 008 — before that,
-- api/scout.js checked `plan === 'free'`, a value the enum can't even
-- hold, so the Scout daily-call limit silently never applied to anyone).
-- profiles.role's enum values are still unconfirmed.
--
-- Confirmed real base-table shape (2026-07-07 introspection, athletes
-- columns extended 2026-07-15 by migration 008):
--   profiles(id, full_name, role enum, plan enum('starter'|'pro'|'elite'),
--            dob, created_at, is_minor, pending_parent_email, is_admin,
--            stripe_customer_id)
--   athletes(id, sport, position, height_cm, weight_kg, grad_year, gpa,
--            club_id, highlights jsonb, created_at, gender, bio, foot,
--            recruiting_status, country, club_name)
--            — id IS profiles.id, there is no separate profile_id column
--            — club_id/clubs is a separate, empty, read-only directory;
--              club_name is the real free-text field the UI actually uses
--   coaches(id, club_id, title)         — RLS on, zero policies, fully locked
--   agents(id, agency)                  — RLS on, zero policies, fully locked
--   clubs(id, name, city, country, created_at)  — no write policy, read-only, empty
--   parent_links(id, parent_id, athlete_id, relationship, approved_at, created_at)
--   scout_history(id, user_id, messages jsonb, created_at)
--   follows(follower_id, followed_id, created_at)
--   messages(id, sender_id, recipient_id, body, created_at, read_at)
--
-- Everything below this point (posts, post_likes, events, gender column,
-- the parent-verification RPC/policies, is_minor/admin/stripe columns,
-- post_reports, blocks, follows, messages, editable-profile columns) is
-- fully created by the statements in this file — safe to re-run against
-- the live project (every statement is idempotent: create-if-not-exists /
-- create-or-replace / drop-then-create policy).
--
-- Migration history, in the order actually applied:
--   1. (undocumented — created the base tables listed above, predates
--      this session)
--   2. supabase-migration-002-posts-events.sql
--   3. supabase-migration-004-fix-real-schema.sql
--   4. supabase-migration-005-launch-readiness.sql

-- 10) ADDITIVE — POSTS (Feed) + POST_LIKES + EVENTS
--     Feed and Events had no backing tables at all (golsz-app.html rendered
--     hardcoded FEED/EVENTS arrays). This section adds them, following the
--     same "public directory read, owner (or parent) write" pattern used by
--     athletes/coaches/clubs above. Safe to append/re-run on top of the
--     tables created earlier in this file.

-- ============================================================
-- Done. Follow-ups, still true here:
--  - Discover now has a `gender` column on athletes to match golsz-app.html's
--    filter UI; it's nullable and unset for existing rows.
--  - Feed/Discover/Events in golsz-app.html fetch from posts/athletes/events
--    when Supabase is configured, falling back to the hardcoded arrays when
--    a query returns zero rows (so the app still looks alive pre-launch).
--  - There's still no UI to create a post or an event — posts/events tables
--    exist and are queried, but nothing writes to them yet apart from
--    post_likes (the Feed's like button).
--  - Scout()'s chat in golsz-app.html doesn't write to scout_history yet —
--    only increment_scout_usage() (called server-side by api/scout.js) logs
--    'usage' rows today. Insert 'user'/'assistant' rows from the client via
--    supabase-js if you want a real transcript, not just a call count.
--  - parent_links.approved_at is set to null on insert (pending) — an
--    actual verification step (email confirmation to the parent, admin
--    review, etc.) should set it before a parent gets real access to a
--    minor's data. Don't let a self-reported parent_links row auto-approve.

-- From supabase-migration-004-fix-real-schema.sql
-- ============================================================

-- ============================================================
-- 004 — Reconcile with the REAL live schema, and finish parent verification
--
-- supabase-schema.sql in this repo does NOT match what's actually deployed.
-- The live database was built up across earlier, undocumented sessions and
-- drifted from that file: different column names, missing columns, and a
-- couple of functions that reference columns which no longer exist. This
-- migration was written directly against the live schema (confirmed via
-- information_schema.columns / pg_proc / pg_policies on 2026-07-07), not
-- against supabase-schema.sql. Treat THIS file, not supabase-schema.sql, as
-- the source of truth going forward until supabase-schema.sql is rewritten
-- to match (tracked separately — see CLAUDE.md).
--
-- Confirmed real shape at the time of writing:
--   profiles(id, full_name, role enum, plan enum, dob, created_at)      -- no email column
--   athletes(id, sport, position, height_cm, weight_kg, grad_year, gpa,
--            club_id, highlights jsonb, created_at, gender)             -- id IS profiles.id, no profile_id column
--   coaches(id, club_id, title)                                          -- RLS enabled, zero policies -> fully locked
--   agents(id, agency)                                                   -- RLS enabled, zero policies -> fully locked
--   clubs(id, name, city, country, created_at)
--   parent_links(parent_id, athlete_id)                                  -- no id/relationship/approved_at/created_at
--   scout_history(id, user_id, messages jsonb, created_at)               -- no role/content/athlete_id columns
--
-- Migration 002 (posts/post_likes/events/athletes.gender) already matches
-- the live schema exactly and does not need to change.
-- ============================================================

-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1) athletes had NO public-read policy — only athletes_rw (owner/parent
--    ALL). Discover needs to read every athlete's row, not just your own.
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
drop policy if exists athletes_read on athletes;
create policy athletes_read on athletes for select using (true);

-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2) handle_new_user() only ever set (id, full_name) and never created the
--    athletes row — so every signup so far has a profiles row with nothing
--    in athletes, which is why Discover/Feed have nothing real to show yet.
--    Add dob capture + auto-create the athletes row. role/plan are left on
--    their column defaults since the signup form doesn't collect a role
--    today (matches current product behavior — don't invent enum values).
-- ------------------------------------------------------------

insert into athletes (id)
select p.id from profiles p
where not exists (select 1 from athletes a where a.id = p.id);

-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- 3) increment_scout_usage() referenced scout_history(athlete_id, role,
--    content) — none of those columns exist on the real table
--    (id, user_id, messages, created_at). It would have errored at runtime
--    the moment Scout metering was ever actually exercised (SUPABASE_URL
--    unset in Vercel so far, so this hasn't surfaced yet). Rewritten
--    against the real columns: a metering call inserts a row with an empty
--    messages array, and today's count is rows where messages = '[]' — real
--    transcript rows (written by the client) always have a non-empty
--    array, so counting by the empty marker keeps metering accurate
--    regardless of how many transcript rows exist.

-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- 4) parent_links verification (child approves the parent) — for real this
--    time, against the actual (parent_id, athlete_id) table. Adds the
--    columns the live table never had, closes the "any linked row = full
--    access" hole in is_parent_of(), and adds request/approve/deny.
--    Still mutual in-app consent, not identity-verified parental consent.

  );

-- ============================================================
-- Done. Still true / known gaps after this migration:
--  - coaches/agents have RLS enabled with zero policies -> fully locked to
--    every client, including their own owner. Not touched here since
--    nothing in the app currently signs anyone up as coach/agent (role is
--    never set from the signup form). Revisit if/when that's built.
--  - clubs has no write policy at all (read-only to every client).
--  - This is mutual in-app consent for parent access, not COPPA/GDPR-K
--    verified parental consent. Get legal input before relying on it for
--    real minors at launch.
-- ============================================================

-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- 5) profiles has no public-read policy at all (only profiles_self and the
--    parent_links-scoped profiles_linked added above) — correct, since
--    profiles.dob is sensitive, especially for minors. But that means
--    Feed/Discover embedding profiles(full_name) through athletes/posts
--    silently returns null for anyone else's row. A blanket "select using
--    (true)" policy would fix the embed but also expose dob/role/plan to
--    every authenticated user, which we don't want. Instead: a narrow view
--    exposing only (id, full_name), owned by postgres so it bypasses RLS
--    on the base table while only ever surfacing those two columns.
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
create or replace view public_profile_names as
select id, full_name from profiles;

grant select on public_profile_names to anon, authenticated;

--
-- IMPORTANT — read before running: the minor-safety mechanism below is

-- row is auto-created; the minor stays restricted — no public posts, not

--    mechanic yet — undefined product scope, not built here.

-- 1) New editable athlete profile fields. bio/foot/recruiting_status/
--    country/club_name were all display-only fake data in golsz-app.html
--    before this — no columns existed. club_name is deliberately free
--    text rather than the clubs(id) FK: clubs is an empty, read-only
--    directory with no insert policy (a separate, unbuilt "verified club"
--    feature), not something a user can register themselves into today.

alter table athletes add column if not exists recruiting_status text;
alter table athletes add column if not exists country text;
alter table athletes add column if not exists club_name text;
-- owner/parent write access to these is already covered by the
-- pre-existing athletes_rw policy — no new RLS needed.

-- 2) handle_new_user() captured the chosen plan in signup metadata but
--    never applied it to profiles.plan, which silently kept its column
--    default ('starter') for every signup. Separately, api/scout.js's
--    free-tier Scout limit checks `plan === 'free'` — a value the
--    plan_tier enum doesn't even contain (confirmed live: only
--    'starter' | 'pro' | 'elite' are valid) — so that check could never
--    fire for anyone, on any plan. Net effect: the Scout daily-call
--    limit has not been enforced for a single user in production.
--    Fixed here (enum-safe) and in api/scout.js + api/stripe-webhook.js,
--    which now check/set 'starter' instead of the nonexistent 'free'.
